/* 
 * chill.c - calculate the windchill based on current temperature and wind speed
 * 
 * usage: chill [temperature] [wind speed]
 * where:
 *   temperature is the temperature at which windchill is to be calculated
 *   wind speed is the velocity of the wind at which windchill is to be calculated
 * output:
 *   read the temperature and wind speed and calculate using the formula  Wind Chill = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75(V^0.16) + 0.4275T(V^0.16)
 *   and print to stdout the temperature, wind speed and corresponding windchill. If no windspeed given, give windchill for 5, 10, 15mph and if no temp
 *   given, give windchill for -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40F. 
 * stdin: the input template
 * stdout: the modified template

### Compile the code

[flume:chill] 103) mygcc -o chill chill.c -lm

### Test the basic operations: no parameters, one parameter and two parameters, all ints or floats

[flume:chill] 104) ./chill

### Test simple cases where temperature or wind speed are out of bounds, or too many arguments provided

[flume:chill] 107) ./chill 55
Temparature must be less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit
[flume:chill] 108) ./chill 10 0
Wind Speed must be greater than or equal to 0.5MPH
[flume:chill] 109) ./chill 55 0
Temparature must be less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit
[flume:chill] 110) ./chill 55 0 64
usage: too many arguments provided. 

[flume:chill] 111) ./chill 55 0 64 76.876503
usage: too many arguments provided. 

### Test cases where non-ints and non-floats are passed as parameters to chill. NOTE: undesired behavior expected


[flume:chill] 112) ./chill r rsb
Wind Speed must be greater than or equal to 0.5MPH
[flume:chill] 113) ./chill r b
Wind Speed must be greater than or equal to 0.5MPH
[flume:chill] 114) ./chill r r
Wind Speed must be greater than or equal to 0.5MPH
[flume:chill] 115) ./chill r R
Wind Speed must be greater than or equal to 0.5MPH
[flume:chill] 116) ./chill raunak bhojwani
Wind Speed must be greater than or equal to 0.5MPH
