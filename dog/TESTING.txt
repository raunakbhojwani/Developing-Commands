README for dog.c
Raunak Bhojwani, April 2016

Compiling:
	gcc -o dog dog.c

/* ge:
 * dog.c - provide some functionality of cat with some extra features
 * 
 * usage: dog [—-help]
 * usage: dog [-n] [-m mapfile] [-M mapfile] [-] [filename]...
 * where:
 *   —-help is the option that shows this README file for more information
 *   -n is the option that enables numbered lines for the output
 *   -m mapfile is the option that takes a filename as an argument and uses it to encrypt its inputs with a simple substitution cipher
 *   -M mapfile is very similar to -m but it uses the filename to decrypt its inputs
 *   only one of -m and -M can be used
 * output:
 *   read the input from the files or from stdin and depending on the options indicated, output onto stdout. If -n is indicated, include 
 *   numbered lines. If -m or -M indicated, encrypt/decrypt the input before output to stdout
 *   
 * stdin: the files indicated. if special file ‘-‘ indicated, or no files indicated, stdin is used as input
 * stdout: stdout
 * stderr: error messages
 *

Example command lines:
	
  dog
  dog —-help
  dog -n -m mapfile.txt 
  dog -n filename1 - filename2
  dog -n -M mapfile.txt filename1 filename2 - - - filename3

Exit status:
  0 - success
  1 - unable to understand option/mapfile not given to -m or -M
  2 - both options -m and -M indicates
  3 - curl_easy_perform failed
  4 - code entered could not be found on database
  5 - incorrect number of parameters.

Assumptions:

- a lot of the functionality of curl is assumed in this program. it is assumed that the station 
  code must be exactly 4 characters long and be completely uppercase. if this is not the case, an
  error will be found.
- i am assuming that you have access to all the files i have submitted in the tarball. my use of the
  ezxml parser meant that i had to make some files in my weather directory. you shouldn’t have a problem
  with this, but if you do please download the ezxml parser and use the ‘make’ command in the weather directory
  before compiling the code.


"Non"-Assumptions:

- the four letter code entered must correspond to a code on the weather.gov database, or else an error will be printed.


Limitations:

- the program uses only the w1.weather.gov database, so it is not an exhaustive source of weather information.
  accuracy of the information is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the information of the database.
